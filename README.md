Money Game
The object of the game is for the player to become the Manager of the 7-8A Hedge Fund Company. You start as an Analyst and have to work your way up, by making a certain amount of money. The way this game will work is that each time the player makes the right decision (short, sell, buy, cover) in a given situation, they will make a certain amount of money. Once they hit certain benchmarks, they get promoted. When you mess up more than three times in a given level, you go down one position. The game will be set up by basically introducing the player to the rules and then giving different questions (Example: Amazon is about to release their third quarter earnings of 2018. The company currently owns 4,000 shares. Should we buy 4,000 or short 4,000 prior to the release?). As you progress, the questions will get harder.
